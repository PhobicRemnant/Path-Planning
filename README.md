# Path-Planning

Here we have all code that deals with the Path Planning problem, currently the implementations are thought to solve 2D problems.

## Path planning implementations on C++.

### Current state:

  - A* on a 2D map with just one robot.
  - Window display of map and solution with SFML library.

### Future state:

  - A* on a 2D map with multiple robots.
  - Live configuration of start and goal points.
  - Have a menu, humans love a good menu.
  - Create a random map for the planner to solve.

## Python:

To do:

  - Fast Marching Method propagation

## C++:

  -Use wxWidgets or Qt for GUI with Path Planner.
